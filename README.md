# Pulling Gifs from Giphy with Ajax

Using the GIPHY API with JQuery's Ajax, this website uses buttons to grab 10 gifs from the value of the button and displays them as stills. A click on those displayed gifs makes it go from still to animated.

There is also a form to add more buttons if necessary.
